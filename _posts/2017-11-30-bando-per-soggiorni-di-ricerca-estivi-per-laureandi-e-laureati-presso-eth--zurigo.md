	The Computer Science Department at ETH offers a summer research fellowship for undergraduate and graduate students over the summer months (1 July – 31 August 2018). Applications for the program are open to all students – international students are particularly encouraged (deadline: 31 December 2017).  
  
The program offers:

* **Research experience**: fellows will pursue a research project that aligns with a chosen area of their interest as part of a research group in the CS department. This includes interacting and collaborating with group members.
* **Networking and socializing**: a number of on-site socializing events will help fellows to get to know people outside their respective research groups, including current ETH students at both undergraduate and graduate levels.
* **Stipend**: fellows will receive a monthly allowance to cover housing and living expenses. Travel and visa expenses will be covered as well.
* **Accommodation**: assistance is provided for finding affordable housing during the research stay, once a candidate is accepted into the program. ETH will also provide information regarding visa applications (where required).
